TSUMUGI (Trait-driven Surveillance for Mutation-based Gene module Identification) is a web tool for visualizing phenotype-driven gene networks.

The name TSUMUGI is derived from the phrase **紡ぎ**, symbolizing the concept of *twisting various things (genes) together to create one unified entity (phenotype)*.
